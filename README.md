# Big Bad Boaty Boy

#### Shoot em up built as part of a group project at Epicodus

#### By **Joel Adams**

## Description

This app is a shoot em' up style 2D game built using Unity as my contribution to a group project as a student at Epicodus. The game begins with a standard start menu, where the user may play the game or quit the application (the user may also press "ESC" to quit or "ENTER" to start the game.) Once the game has been started the player is given control of a boat, using WASD to control movement and the spacebar to fire. Enemy boats are generated at random from the top of the screen. In order of likelihood to spawn (from most likley to least likely) there are small zodiac boats, medium sized yachts that fire lasers, and large pirate ships that fire three projectiles in a spread pattern.
Upon destruction, each enemy may spawn a repair power up (that increases the player's health total shown on the bottom left of the screen), or a weapons power up that increases the player's rate of fire and adds a spread shot for a limited time. The user's "score" is shown at the top of the screen, and is increased by damaging enemies with the player's own projectiles or by destroying an enemy entirely. The player's game time is also tallied at the top right corner of the screen. Once the player's health drops to zero the program loads the menu.
